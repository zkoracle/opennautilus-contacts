# Contributing to OpenNautilus Contracts

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to OpenNautilus Contracts? You can start by browsing through the 'Issues' tab in the GitHub repository.

- **"good first issue"**: These issues are well-suited for those new to the codebase, or who rarely contribute to open source projects.

- **"bug"**: These represent known bugs in the project. They are a place where you can do some real good!

## Coding Conventions

The project uses a strict linting program to enforce coding style, it's recommended to set up this linter in your IDE before making modifications and commit. You can use `npm run lint` to check linting and `npm run fix` to auto fix some linting errors.

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Ensure your code lints.
5. Make sure your change doesn't break the build.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Commit Messages

Use the "Conventional Commits" standard to format commit messages. This is better for readability and helps with generating changelogs automatically.


## Reporting an Issue

- **Do a quick search and see if the issue has already been reported**

- **Provide as much information as possible**. Include examples, screenshots or other information if possible.

- **Try to isolate the issue**. The closer you can get to the exact, minimal piece of code that reproduces the problem, the better.

## Additional Notes

This is a rapidly evolving project. If you have any ideas or suggestions, we'd love to hear about it. Open an issue, send us a message, or make a pull request. However you choose to get involved, we'll be glad to have you on board!
